# etch-a-sketch

This project is to push my DOM Manipulation skills and create an Etch-a-Sketch. The basic functionality of etch-a-sketch is present which includes drawing when the mouse is clicked over a pixel and reseting the grid. With the basic functionality out of the way, it's been decided I'm moving on from the project to focus on other more meaningful projects. In addition, there is a color selector with a minor drawback in the first pixel being clicked after selecting a new color will still be the old color in some cases. This is due to the color slider window not confirming the choice before the pixel gets colored. 

<h1> Key takeaways: </h1>
1) I got a really good amount of practice understanding event listeners and using Javascript to manipulate CSS fields.
2) Learned about event delegation and how it can improve performance by using fewer listeners on the parent elements.
